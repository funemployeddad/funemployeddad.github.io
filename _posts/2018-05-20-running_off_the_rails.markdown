The Rails portfolio project has been an eye-opening experience, both because of how much I was able to do, and also because of how much I had to go back and relearn or finally get for the first time. This was really the culmination of all that I've done to this point, and it was encouraging to see my work take shape and bring a site to life. It was then immediately frustrating to see that work show up in a poorly formatted, 'wonky' site. 

Having things not work when you are coding is great because it helps direct your focus and attention. Find a problem, fix it, then find whatever problems your fix created and fix those. Rinse and repeat. As the site got more complicated, using nested routes and resources, along with a combination of OAuth and BCrypt for authentication, the reprecussions of every 'fix' became more and more prevalent. This really forced me to stop and take a look at the big picture of how the items were interconnected to figure out how to make them all play nice. After that, it was time to try and get BootStrap up and running for my basic formatting, then to find a basic theme for the site and add some images/videos to the asset pipeline. 

At the end of it all, I was able to make a site that does some things basically the way I intended, and doesn't look awful doing it. I'm calling that an accomplishment. Next time I will have a huge head start because of the lessons I learned on this one, so it's off to JavaScript. Being a real web developer, here I come!
