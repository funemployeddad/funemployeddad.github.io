Today I finished my first pass through of my Sinatra Portfolio app, which I have titled TBD, or The Brain Dump. It is a note-taking app styled after Evernote, or other note/to-do list apps. It is simply, yet effective, and fulfills all of the requirements of a CRUD app.

The first step for anyone who wants to use this app would be to create an account. The data they enter is checked to make sure that all fields are completed and that the username does not already exist in the database. Once they have cretaed their account, they are automatically logged in and can see their homepage for notes. This page will allow them to see clickable links of the titles of all of their notes, while keeping the content of those notes hidden. They can also quickly add a note right from that page using the form at the bottom of the page. 

Once they select one of their notes, the user will then see that note in detail, including the content, and buttons for editing or deleting the note. If they select one of those options, they can make their changes, and will then be rerouted to their homepage for notes. 

The app is not overly complex. It has a job, and it does that job quickly and securely.
