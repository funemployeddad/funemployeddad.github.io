Hello World!

In the time honored tradition of coding, going all the way back to olden days of coding in C in 1978, this simple line of code is our first step into a future filled with composition and compilation errors, butting your head against the wall trying to make what seems like a simple task work, and finally getting that rush when it does what you intended it to (and nothing you didn't)!

Moving out of campus management in the Private Post-Secondary Education industy is a big step for me. I was a rockstar in that industry, moving from part-time faculty to running an 11 million a year in revenue school in under 4 years. However, this is also the industry where I was out of work 3 times in three years due to school closings, shady C-level bosses, and a recovering economy (which throws higher education enrollments into the toilet). I loved what I did there for a lot of my 7 years in Higher Ed, and was able to see thousands of students graduate and improve their situtations for themselves and their families. However, I also was burnt out from unreasonable expecations, a lack of training and funding for my teams, and having to be teacher, counselor, friend, mentor, and parent to so many of my students. 

So here I am, taking the plunge and changing careers. Like so many of the students I've seen and helped before, I'm ready to face the challenges ahead of me. I know first hand how tough it is to balance your obligations to your family, friends, and community while trying to pursue a career change, but I've been lucky enough to see so many students who were able to do so that I have confidence that not only will I get through this, but I will thive and come out so much better on the other side.

To those taking this ride with me, get in your routine as soon as you can and be selfish. A few months of focusing on you will allow you to better support your family and be a better friend. At the same time, don't forget that you're human and you need to take breaks to recharge. 

I look forward to having you all come along on this ride with me.
