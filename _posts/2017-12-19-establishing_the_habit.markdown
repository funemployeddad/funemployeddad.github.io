One month, and 27% of the program down, and I've started to evaluate how this experience is going. As I do, I'm struck by a couple thoughts/feelings:

1. It's not as easy as I thought it was going to be. 
2. I'm enjoying it more than I thought I was going to.
3. I don't know if I'm ready for the increase in complexity that is surely rapidly approaching.

Of those three, I was the most surprised by the second than the other two. I've flirted with learning to code twice before, but for some reason, this seems to be sticking better and I'm enjoying the process of getting to the right answers more than before. When I had tried earlier, it seemed like I was always annoyed about not having the right answers right away, or having any difficulty in getting my code to work the way I wanted it to. Now, it seems like I am enjoying the process of figuring things out more. 

Hopefully those feelings continue as I get to more difficult stuff that is going to rely on my being able to use these foundational skills we've been going over.
