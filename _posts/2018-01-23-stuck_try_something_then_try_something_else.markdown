Recently I've been working on the final projects for the OO unit. So far I've built a basic MP3 library/player, and a very basic Tic Tac Toe AI machine, and now I'm on to scraping. 

As you may imagine, working through these projects has led to a number of moments of frustration where things just don't work (I'm looking at you #turn....). 

One thing that Avi has stressed in a number of his videos is that trying things is free, and will often lead to you making progress. One of the worst things you can do is try to fix every single issue all at the same time. You'll get vaporlocked trying to puzzle through the complexity of the issue instead of finding a piece of the problem, fixing it, and moving on to the next.

So next time you get stuck on a tricky method or class, take a breathe, talk through the problem and try to verbalize what you want to accomplish, and then just TRY SOMETHING! Either it's right or it's not, but either way you have more info to solve the issue with.
