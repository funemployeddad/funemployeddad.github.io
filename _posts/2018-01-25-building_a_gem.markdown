I'm working through my final projects in the OO section, and I get to this, the last one, the culmination of everything that has come before. I open up the page and start reading the requirements, and all of a sudden I start feeling like I've been thrown in the deep end of the pool. 

As I read through the assignment, some thoughts pass through my mind. Thoughts like:
* What do you mean there are no tests? You expect me to just what, figure it out without strict guidance?!?!
* I have to make all those extra files that have always just magically appeared in my directory and populate them with meaningful data? Do I look like a magician?
* I can do this assignment on ANY website I want? Ok, pick a website. Should be easy right? There's only a couple billion of them out there....

Once the shock started wearing off, I started getting excited about this project because of those things that were initially scary. Yes, I get to build whatever app I want, to get data from whatever website I want, and then I can do anything I want with it. I don't need no stinking tests, I got all the tools I need in my previous coursework, in the video lectures, and with Google.

I started planning out what I was going to build. I'm a bit of a nerd, and one of my hobbies is to play a game called Magic the Gathering. It's a card game that uses a variety of different cards to build a deck and compete with an opponent. Strategies and metagames abound in this game, and due to that, a number of websites have appeared to provide content related to the game. One of the go-to sites for info on the current metagames in the various formats is MTGGoldfish (www.mtggoldfish.com). They have a wealth of info on deck lists, winning deck percentages, pricing, and any other piece of data you could ever want when deciding what deck to build and play. 

My idea for my gem was to build a scraper that would extract the data from the most popular formats in the game, standard and modern, and list that data to the user of the app. Once that data was listed, the user could then interact with it by selecting a deck from the list to get more information about that deck. The great thing about this app is that it's expandable in a couple of ways from here. I can include more formats, like pauper or legacy. I can also go more indepth on an individual deck and scrape it's dedicated deck list page, returning details on the cards, quantities, and prices that make up that individual deck. None of that funtionality is currently in the V1 of the app, but it is there for the building if/when I want to refactor and expand this app.

I've included the video walkthrough of my code and demonstration of the app below in case you want to check it out.
