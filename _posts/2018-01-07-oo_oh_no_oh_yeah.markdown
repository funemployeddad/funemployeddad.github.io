Moving out of Procedural Ruby and into Object Oriented Ruby was a little milestone that I was looking forward to hitting. OO seems more intuitive from first glance, and I was really excited to get to this section. Building classes that act as blueprints and factories, and teaching them to interact with each other properly is exactly how I want to code. I was cruising through the intro sections and thought this was going to be a breeze.

Then the holidays hit. Normally I'm indifferent to happy during the holidays, but this year was different. Two days before Christmas I got the dreaded MAN COLD, which rapidly spread to both my toddlers. Nothing like 3 big sick babies at Christmas. Also, I lost my father to pancreatic cancer about two months ago, and that still comes out of the blue to hit me where it hurts. Needless to say, my enthusiasm for OO quickly degenerated into dreading turning on the computer because everything hurt, I couldn't concentrate, and I was taking care of two sick kiddos who magically got worse every time I would reach for my laptop.

I'm back on the horse now, after taking some (probably not expired) leftover antibiotics I found in my fridge from when I got sick last year, and I'm looking forward to getting through this section and getting on the the CLI portfolio project next weekend.
